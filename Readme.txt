# Stop Procrastination Chrome Extension

## Overview

The Stop Procrastination Chrome Extension is a powerful tool designed to combat the pervasive issue of procrastination in the digital age. By intercepting requests to popular time-wasting websites like YouTube and Facebook, the extension redirects users to custom 404 pages with motivational messages, effectively reminding them of the importance of staying focused on their goals. In a world filled with distractions, this extension serves as a gentle yet impactful intervention to help individuals make better use of their time and increase productivity.

## How It Works

This extension operates seamlessly within Google Chrome, requiring minimal effort from the user. When a user attempts to access a website that has been identified as a potential source of procrastination, such as YouTube or Facebook, the extension steps in. Instead of loading the requested website, the extension redirects the user to a locally hosted 404 page. This page features a motivational message, such as "Studying is greater than YouTube" or "Studying is greater than Facebook," encouraging the user to reconsider their actions and prioritize more meaningful tasks. By interrupting the automatic urge to procrastinate, the extension empowers users to make better decisions about how they spend their time online.

## Real-Life Example

Imagine a professional working on an important project with a tight deadline. Despite the urgency of the task at hand, they find themselves repeatedly checking social media or watching irrelevant videos on YouTube, diminishing their productivity and increasing their stress levels. In this scenario, the Stop Procrastination Chrome Extension can make a significant difference. By installing the extension and configuring it to target distracting websites, the professional creates a virtual barrier between themselves and these sources of procrastination. When they instinctively navigate to YouTube or Facebook in search of a brief distraction, they are met with a motivational 404 page reminding them of their priorities. This subtle yet effective intervention prompts the professional to refocus their attention on the task at hand, leading to increased productivity and a greater sense of accomplishment.
